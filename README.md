# Other Repositories

Arcus Platform does not contain a UI (beyond oculus, which is in Java). If you wish to access Arcus from a phone or web browser check out the other repositories under arcus-smart-home, these include:

* **arcusandroid** - Android app for Arcus Platform

# High Level Overview
Please see [Overview](docs/overview.md) for details. At present, local development is tricky to get setup and takes a considerable amount of time to configure. It is instead recommended that you setup Arcus in a container system, for example Kubernetes. See the community effort [arcus-k8](https://github.com/wl-net/arcus-k8) for details.

Please see [README.projects](docs/projects.md) for details on the layout of this project. Individual subdirectories may have their own additional documentation.
